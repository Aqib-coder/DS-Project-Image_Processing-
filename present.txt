Assalam o alikum 

So my name is Aqib ali and i am going to discuss the last but not least style of communication 
which is assertive style 

Ok so what is assertive style,   the definition on slide
ok nice but what  it means so actually assertive style means to communicate in a way
that the needs of both persons should be focused..

The communicator value his time and rights as well as the other person

So let consider the previos example of passive aggressive style and make the scenario assertive
"The example in which a man said to his friend to paint tha wall and he ruins the wall by 
colouring it badly beacuse he doesn't know how to paint, so as a assertive communicator he says to his friend
that i can't do that because i don't know how to do it".

Now consider another example which u all will tell how the child make it assertive..
